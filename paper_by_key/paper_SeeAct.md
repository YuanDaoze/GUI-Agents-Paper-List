    - 💻 Env: [GUI]
    - 🔑 Key: [framework], [visual grounding], [GUI agents], [cross-platform generalization], [UGround], [SeeAct-V], [synthetic data]
    - 📖 TLDR: This paper introduces UGround, a universal visual grounding model for GUI agents that enables human-like navigation of digital interfaces. The authors advocate for GUI agents with human-like embodiment that perceive the environment entirely visually and take pixel-level actions. UGround is trained on a large-scale synthetic dataset of 10M GUI elements across 1.3M screenshots. Evaluated on six benchmarks spanning grounding, offline, and online agent tasks, UGround significantly outperforms existing visual grounding models by up to 20% absolute. Agents using UGround achieve comparable or better performance than state-of-the-art agents that rely on additional textual input, demonstrating the feasibility of vision-only GUI agents.

- [GPT-4V(ision) is a Generalist Web Agent, if Grounded](https://osu-nlp-group.github.io/SeeAct/)

    - 💻 Env: [Web]
    - 🔑 Key: [framework], [dataset], [benchmark], [grounding], [SeeAct], [Multimodal-Mind2web]
    - 📖 TLDR: This paper explores the capability of GPT-4V(ision), a multimodal model, as a web agent that can perform tasks across various websites by following natural language instructions. It introduces the **SEEACT** framework, enabling GPT-4V to navigate, interpret, and interact with elements on websites. Evaluated using the **Mind2Web** benchmark and an online test environment, the framework demonstrates high performance on complex web tasks by integrating grounding strategies like element attributes and image annotations to improve HTML element targeting. However, grounding remains challenging, presenting opportunities for further improvement.
